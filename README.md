## ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that API Control Plane is compatible with API Gateway version 10.15.0.8 and above.</span>

# webMethods API Control Plane

APIs are everywhere. API Management is where APIs are. It‚Äôs all distributed and heterogeneous. Management and administration becomes harder. API Management technology should blend in into the rest of the infrastructure and be managed from one place. API Control Plane is a single solution for understanding, managing and controlling the entire API Management landscape, regardless of where it is, on premises or in the cloud. Things in the API Control Plane are organized across:

- Data planes - these are logical groupings of your gateways, portals and other runtimes dealing with APIs.
- Runtimes - there are your API Gateways, developer portals etc.
- APIs - that's self-explanatory. These are APIs present in your landscape.

This repository hosts assets documenting how to deploy and run webMethods API Control Plane, articles and tutorials, public API docs and Postman collections wooing who to use them and more.

## Deploying API Control Plane

We have two ways of deploying a self-hosted version of API Control Plane - using docker compose and using helm.

- For deployment instructions using docker compose go [here](deployment/docker/README.md).
- For deployment instructions using helm on kubernetes go [here](deployment/helm/README.md).

## Public APIs

API Control Plane exposes public APIs to interact with it. API docs as well as postman collection with sample usage can be found [here](apis).

## License for Control Plane Application
### Loading license to Application
- A valid license file is to be mounted.
- The docker composes and/or helm charts file is to be modified to mount the license file.
- The control plane will load the license file from the mounted path configured through the environment variable `APICP_LICENSE_PATH`. This will happen during application start-up.
- The other way to load the license after startup is by using the rest endpoints. Please to the Open API spec for the details.
- The license file may have either one of the two product codes specified below
  - WCOS1: for on-prem instances
  - WCOC1: for cloud instances
- This license information is validated in the control plane for both the license types and added to the control plane.
- But the application will work / block based on the corresponding license is added and the mode of the application.

### Application Behaviour without a valid license
- All the PUT, POST and DELETE API calls to the control plane application will be blocked, and 406 HTTP status code 
  will be returned as a response code.

## Agent SDK

Agent SDK is a Java API, which can be used to develop Java application which can fetch runtime details and metrics 
information from Runtime and send to Control Plane. A detailed document is available [here](https://documentation.softwareag.com/wco/11.0.0/en/webhelp/wco-webhelp/#page/wco-webhelp%2Fco-agent_sdk.html).

## Articles

We also host various articles related to API Control Plane deployment, use, administration etc. [here](articles).
