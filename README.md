# IBM webMethods API Control Plane

APIs are everywhere. API Management is where APIs are. It‚Äôs all distributed and heterogeneous. Management and administration becomes harder. API Management technology should blend in into the rest of the infrastructure and be managed from one place. API Control Plane is a single solution for understanding, managing and controlling the entire API Management landscape, whether it's self-hosted, in private clouds, in a public cloud, or a hybrid combination of any of these. Assets in the API Control Plane are organized across:

- APIs - whereever they are deployed, however many versions they have
- Runtimes - API Gateways from any vendor, custom runtime implementations, or developer portals
- Data planes - Logical groupings of your runtimes. For example, certain cloud gateways, customer facing runtimes, geographical groupings

This repository hosts assets documenting how to deploy and run IBM webMethods API Control Plane as a container, articles and tutorials, public API docs and Postman collections. Please see the official documentation for [cloud](https://docs.webmethods.io/apicontrolplane/welcome/home/#gsc.tab=0) or [self-hosted](https://docs.webmethods.io/on-premises/webmethods-api-control-plane) for how to use the product and system requirements. 

## Deploying API Control Plane

We have two ways of deploying a self-hosted version of API Control Plane - using docker compose and using helm.

- For deployment instructions using Docker Compose, go [here](deployment/docker/README.md).
- For deployment instructions using Helm Charts on Kubernetes, go [here](deployment/helm/README.md).

## Connecting runtimes to the API Control Plane

API Control Plane provides native support for connecting with webMethods API Gateway and an agent SDK to connect with any runtime. We also provide some sample agents for third party API gateways. Please see [here](deployment/agent/) for detailed information about those.

## Public APIs

API Control Plane exposes public REST APIs to interact with it. API docs as well as Postman collection with samples can be found [here](apis).

## License for Control Plane Application
### Loading the license
- You need a valid license to user the API Control Plane.
- The docker composes and/or helm charts file needs to be modified to mount the license file.
- The API Control Plane will load the license file from the mounted path configured through the environment variable `APICP_LICENSE_PATH`. This will happen during application start-up.
- You can use the REST API to load or update the license file after startup. Please see [its OAS](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/webmethods-api-control-plane/blob/main/apis/openapi-specifications/license-management.yaml) for details.
- The license file may have either one of the two product codes specified below
  - WCOS1: for on-prem instances
  - WCOC1: for cloud instances
- This license information is validated in the API Control Plane for both the license types.

### Behavior without a valid license
- All the PUT, POST and DELETE API calls to the API Control Plane application will be blocked, and 406 HTTP status code 
  will be returned as a response code.
