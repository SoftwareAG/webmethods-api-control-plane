## How to deploy webMethods API Control Plane using helm?

1. Clone this repository
2. Login to https://containers.softwareag.com/
3. Get a Personal Access Token (PAT)

    We published docker images for all API Control Plane microservice to https://containers.softwareag.com/ repository. To be able to pull them, you'll need a Personal Access token (PAT). To get a PAT, go to Userprofile > Settings > Generate password. Store Token Password securely.
4. Create a kubernetes namespace for your deployment

    Execute the following command

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace control-plane
    ```

    If everything goes well the output should be similar to

    ```bash
    [user@somehost helm]$ kubectl create namespace control-plane
    namespace/control-plane created
    ```

5. Create a kubernetes secret to be able to pull docker images

    Execute the following command

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred -n control-plane --docker-server=sagcr.azurecr.io --docker-username=[Your git username] --docker-password=[Your PAT]
    ```

    If everything goes well the output should be similar to

    ```bash
    [user@somehost helm]$ kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred -n control-plane --docker-server=sagcr.azurecr.io --docker-username=przemekuliok --docker-password=*secret*
    secret/regcred created created
    ```

6. Configure your deployment

    The [values.yaml](values.yaml) file allows to configure different aspects of API Control Plane deployment. To be able to access API Control Plane after it's deployed, you need to edit this file and provide a value for `domainName` that matches the hostname of the machine you're deploying API Control plane on. Make sure this hostname is accessible to whoever will be connecting to API Control Plane.

    If you don't want to use the `latest` version and prefer a specific one, make sure to update the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file for appropriate versions of the docker image you want to use for ingress, ui, engine and asset catalog applications. Go [here](https://github.com/orgs/SoftwareAG/packages?repo_name=webmethods-api-control-plane) so see what's available.

    Default configuration is set up to deploy 2 replicas of API Control Plane containers and 1 replica for others. Edit the values.yaml file to change that as needed.

7. Execute the deployment script

    To deploy the API Control Plane with default configuration:

    - change to deployment/docker directory:

        ```bash
        cd deployment/helm
        ```

    - execute the deployment script

        ```bash
        helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace control-plane --wait --timeout 5m0s control-plane .
        ```

    If everything goes well, the output should be similar to this

    ```bash
    [user@somehost helm]$ helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --namespace control-plane --wait --timeout 5m0s control-plane .
    Release "control-plane" does not exist. Installing it now.
    NAME: control-plane
    LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Apr  7 11:37:53 2023
    NAMESPACE: control-plane
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    TEST SUITE: None
    ```
  
8. Verify it's started

    It will take a couple of minutes to start. You can monitor that with solutions like Portainer or Docker\Kubernetes Dashboard etc. or simply user Docker\Kubernetes CLI like this

    ```bash
    [user@somehost helm]$ kubectl get all -n control-plane

## Additional deployment flavors

### 1. Enabling Open Telemetry using Jaeger

API Control plane can be started in debug mode with Open telemetry enabled and exposed using [Jaeger UI](https://www.jaegertracing.io/). For this, the deployment needs additional image, namely `jaegertracing/all-in-one`.

To enable it set the property `applications.jaegertracing.enabled` to `true` in `values.yaml` file (line 111).

```yaml
  jaegertracing:
    enabled: true
    name: jaeger-tracing
    #--- Jaeger Tracer image name
    imageName: jaegertracing/all-in-one
    #--- Jaeger Tracer image tag
    imageTag: latest
    #--- Jaeger Tracer image replicas number
    replicas: 1
    #--- Port to run Jaeger.
    port : 4317
    #--- UI Port in which Jaeger is exposed
    uiPort: 16686
     #--- Node Port to access JaegarUI outside the cluster 
    extPort: 30007
    storage: 2Gi
    resources:
      # This is just an example. This should be a consious choice of the user. Refer
      # https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hansehe/jaeger-all-in-one/master/helm/jaeger-all-in-one/values.yaml
      limits:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi                                                     
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
    # - Enable to use volume mapping for Jaeger    
    volume:
      enabled: false
      className: ""
      size: 3Gi

```

:wave: The Jaeger UI can be accessed via the `applications.jaegertracing.extPort` port (NodePort type) configured in the `values.ymal` file.

:wave: The Jaeger deployment here is a stateless deployment. Please refer to https://github.com/hansehe/jaeger-all-in-one/tree/master/helm for the complete production level deployment of Jaeger.

### 2. Enabling Gainsight integration

If you want to see [Gainsight](https://www.gainsight.com/product-experience/) powered user engagements (work in progress) in API Control Plane like bots, articles, feature introduction etc., you need to provide additional configuration set up in `values.yaml` file. Please contact your Software AG API Control Plane contact or ask us here for the proper configuration values.

To enable Gainsight integration set `applications.gainsight.enabled` to `true` in `values.yaml` file (line 142). Values for the remaining attributes will be provided to you by Software AG.

```yaml
  gainsight:
    enabled : true
    tenant:
      name: "ACME Inc"
      cloudProvider: "Azure"
      region: "US West Oregon"
      plan: "Free"
      stage: "Staging"
      key: "secret"
```

### 3. Enabling secure Elasticsearch communication

To enable secure communication to Elastic, proper certificates needs to created as kubernetes secrets and provided to the microservices.
Please refer to
https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/main/elasticsearch/examples/security/values.yaml
https://github.com/lisenet/kubernetes-homelab/tree/master/logging 
to enable Elasticsearch over SSL.

## nginx installation
Follow the below steps to install the nginx Ingress Controller. Also refer [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/installation-with-helm/) or [here](https://gcore.com/docs/cloud/kubernetes/networking/install-and-set-up-the-nginx-ingress-controller) for more details.
```
1. kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx
2. helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
3. helm repo update
4. helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --namespace ingress-nginx --set controller.ingressClassResource.name=nginx
```

You can see an output as shown below.
```
NAME: ingress-nginx
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Nov 22 01:30:51 2023
NAMESPACE: ingress-nginx
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
The ingress-nginx controller has been installed.
It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
You can watch the status by running 'kubectl --namespace ingress-nginx get services -o wide -w ingress-nginx-controller'
```
***

## Known issues

1. If your Kubernetes server's version is lower than 1.19, then edit the `templates\nginx_ingress.yaml` file to:

- change the `apiVersion` from 'networking.k8s.io/v1' to 'networking.k8s.io/v1beta1'.
- edit the 'backend' part fo the specification to look like this:

  ```yaml
  backend:
    # service: 
    #   name: {{ .Values.applications.ingress.name }}-svc
    #   port: 
    #     number: 8080            
    serviceName: {{ .Values.applications.ingress.name }}-svc
    servicePort: 8080
  ```
