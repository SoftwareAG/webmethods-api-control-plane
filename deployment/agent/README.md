# API Control Plane Agent

Runtime communicate with API Control Plane with the help of an Agent. Here, we host sample agent configurations for the following runtimes.

1. [webMethods API Gateway](webmethods-api-gateway/README.md)
2. [webmethods Developer Portal]() - coming soon
3. [Azure API Gateway agent](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/webmethods-api-control-plane-agent-azure)
4. [AWS API Gateway agent](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/webmethods-api-control-plane-agent-aws)

# Agent SDK

We also provide a Java based agent SDK that can be used to develop a Java application that fetches runtime details and metrics 
information from any runtime and send to the API Control Plane. A detailed document is available [here](https://docs.webmethods.io/on-premises/webmethods-api-control-plane/11.1.0/webhelp/index.html#page/wco-webhelp%2F_api_cp_webhelp_new.1.138.html).
information from any runtime and send to the API Control Plane. It can be downloaded from Download Components section on [Software AG Empower Portal](https://empower.softwareag.com/).
